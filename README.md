# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow

In this project, we will create a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images from the MNIST dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- Install TensorFlow using `pip install tensorflow`
- Other libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib might be required

## Steps

### 1. Import necessary libraries

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
